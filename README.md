# SDK-Android
![Recast.AI Logo](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJs/blob/master/misc/logo-inline.png)
Recast.AI official SDK for Android.

## Synopsis
This module is an Android interface to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API. It allows you to make requests to your bots.

## Installation
Just update your build.gradle files:

In your module:
```gradle
dependencies {
	compile 'ai.recast.sdk_android:sdk-android:1.0.1'
}
```

## Usage
```java
import ai.recast.sdk_android.Client;
import ai.recast.sdk_android.Response;

Client client = new Client(YOUR_TOKEN);
Response resp;

try {
	resp = client.textRequest(YOUR_TEXT);
} catch (RecastException e) {
	// error
}
```

## Specs
### Classes

This module contains 5 main classes as follows:
* Client is the client allowing you to make requests to Recast.AI API.
* Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* Sentence represents a sentence of the response.
* Entity represents an entity found in you user's input as defined in [Recast.AI Manual](https://man.recast.ai/#list-of-entities)
* RecastException is the error thrown by the module.

### Class Client
The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with or without a token and provides the following methods:

#### Request:
* textRequest(String text)
* textRequest(String text, String token)
* fileRequest(String filename)
* fileRequest(String filename, String token)

These methods both return a Response object.
The token parameter, if provided, override the token given at the construction of the Client.

#### Audio Recording:
* startRecording() *Starts the audio recording to a file*
* stopRecording() *Stops the audio recording, sends the audio to Recast.Ai and returns a Response object*

Note that all these methods should be called in separated tasks because they do http requests.


```java
import ai.recast.sdk_android.Client;
import ai.recast.sdk_android.Response;

Client client = new Client(YOUR_TOKEN);
Response resp;

try {
	resp = client.textRequest("Hello World!");
	// Do your code...
} catch (Exception e) {
	// Handle error
}

try {
	resp = client.fileRequest("my_file.wav");
    // Do you code..
} catch (Exception e) {
	// Handle error
}
```

### Class Response
The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call with the Client methods and contains the following methods:
* getSentence() *Returns the first detected sentence*
* getSentences() *Returns an array of all the sentences*
* getEntity(String name) *Returns the first entity matching -name- or null*
* getEntities(String name) *Returns an array of all entities matching -name- or null*
* getEntities() *Returns a map<String, Entity[]> containing all the entities detected in the input*
* getStatus() *Returns the status of the Response*
* getSource() *Returns the source of the input*
* getIntent() *Returns the main intent detected by Recast.AI*
* getIntents() *Returns all intents ordered by probability*
* getVersion() *Returns the version of the JSON*

```java
resp = client.textRequest("Give me a recipe with Asparagus.");
Sentence s = resp.getSentence();
String intent = resp.getIntent();
if (intent != null && intent.equals("recipe")) {
	//get all the entities matching 'ingredient'
	Entities[] entities = resp.getEntities("ingredient");

	// ...
}
```

### Class Sentence
The Recast.AI sentence is returned by the the Recast.AI Response methods and provides the following methods:
* getSource() *Returns the source of the sentence*
* getType() *Returns the [type](https://man.recast.ai/#types-of-sentence) of the sentence*
* getAction() *Returns the action of the sentence*
* getAgent() *Returns the agent of the sentence, can return null*
* getPolarity() *Returns the polarity of the sentence (positive or negative)*
* getEntities() *Returns a map with entitiy name as key and arrays of Entity as values*
* getEntities(String name) *Returns all entities matching -name-*
* getEntity(String name) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*

```java
Response resp = client.textRequest("Hello you! How are you doing?");
Sentence[] s = resp.getSentences();
// This will print "Hello you!"
System.out.println(s[0].getSource());
// This will print "How are you doing?"
System.out.println(s[1].getSource());
```

### Class Entity
The Recast.AI Entity is returned by Response or Sentence and provides the following methods:
* String getName() *Returns the name of the entity*
* String getRaw() *Returns the raw text on which the entity was detected*
* Object getField(String fieldName)


In addition to getName and getRaw, more attributes can be accessed by the getField method which can be one of the following:
* hex
* value
* deg
* formated
* lng
* lat
* unit
* code
* person
* number
* gender
* next
* grain
* order

Recast.AI entity fields types are dependant on the entity itself, so value returned must be casted depending on the entity you wait.

Refer to [Recast.Ai Entities Manual](https://man.recast.ai/#list-of-entities) for details about entities

```java
Response resp = client.textRequest("What's the weather in San Francisco?");
if (resp.getIntent() != null && resp.getIntent().equals("weather")) {
	Entity e = resp.getEntity("location");
	if (e != null) {
		System.out.printf("You asked me for a weather in %s\n", (String)e.getField("formated"));
	}
}
```

### Class RecastException
This exception is thrown when an error occurs during the request
